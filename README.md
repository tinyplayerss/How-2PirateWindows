# Finalization
Thats it now you have an activated Windows 10 Home without paying for an Activation license.

Note: Updates from Microsoft may break this method so use the command again from earlier to activate windows 10 if it ever gets deactivated.

also Note: You will not have any security risks because you got the Original Windows 10 home edition from Microsoft themselves, the Activation script only activated Windows 10 Home so you dont have the Watermark on the screen.
